## Getting Started

### Fork(recommended)

1. Fork repository [Stlato UI](https://github.com/stlato/stlato-ui)
2. Customize UI
3. Use it

#### How to use your own component library?

Your project's package.json should be looked like this:

```bash
"dependencies": {
  "your-customized-component-library": "git+https://<github_token>:x-oauth-basic@github.com/<user>/<your-foked-repo>.git"
}
```

Then, Use it!

```jsx
import { Button } from "your-customized-component-library";

const YourApp = () => {
  return <Button>Hi There !</Button>;
};
```

### Install(not recommended)

Stlato UI is also available as a package.<br/>
However, it is not recommended to use it as a package because the customization is limited.

```bash
npm i stlato-ui slato-ui-theme stlato-ui-tailwind
```

#### Configure Tailwind

You should add `stlato-ui` to apply the classes from the interactive elements in the tailwind.config.js file:

```js
const { typographyPlugin, tailwindTheme } = require("stlato-ui-tailwind");

/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  content: [
    "./index.html",
    "./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}",
    "./node_modules/stlato-ui/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}", // Add this line
  ],
  theme: tailwindTheme,
  plugins: [typographyPlugin],
};
```
